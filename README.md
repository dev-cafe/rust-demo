### Why Rust

- Fast but also safe
- Zero cost abstractions
- Type system
- Compiler catches most errors (if it compiles, it often just works)
- Compiler provides helpful error messages
- Memory safety
- Thread safety
- Private and immutable by default
- Great tooling (testing, documentation, auto-formatter, dependency management, package registry, no makefiles needed)
- Community
